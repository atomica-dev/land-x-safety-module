  - header: What is LandX Safety Module?
    content: >
      The [LandX Safety Module](https://insurance.landx.fi/ "LandX Safety
      Module") is a widely used safety mechanism to protect users of leading
      DeFi Protocols.\

      Similar to the [AAVE Safety
      Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module "AAVE Safety
      Module"), the [LandX Safety Module](insurance.landx.fi "LandX Safety
      Module") is a smart contract-based security layer made of smart contracts
      and staked assets that protects the [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX
      Protocol") and its users.


      For the users of the [LandX protocol](landx.fi "LandX protocol"), the
      [LandX Safety Module](landx.fi "LandX Safety Module") provides
      asset-backed guarantees of safety and soundness.


      For the stakers, the Safety Module provides a selection of staking pools
      that provide yield funded by risk premiums paid by [LandX](landx.fi
      "LandX") users and rewards from [LandX](landx.fi "LandX") in exchange for
      providing a stake and sharing the risks with other stakers. Just like on
      most staking platforms, there is a small probability that stake may get
      slashed should [LandX Protocol](https://insurance.landx.fi/ "LandX
      Protocol") suffer from a Shortfall Event.


      The Staking Pool APY depends on supply & demand, and is set
      programmatically, just as like interest rates in lending markets such as
      [AAVE](https://aave.com/ "AAVE") and [Compound](https://compound.finance/
      "Compound") are set programmatically based on the utilization of capital
      pools.
  - header: Why stake into LandX's Safety Module?
    content: >
      **Earn Real Yield**: Stakers receive risk premiums and rewards. Rewards
      are accrued in real time in exchange for adding liquidity to the [Safety
      Module](insurance.landx.fi "Safety Module").


      **Diversify Your Portfolio**: The [Safety Module](insurance.landx.fi
      "Safety Module") offers a unique chance to diversify your portfolio with
      an uncorrelated asset (Safety Module Pool Token), while actively
      contributing to the safety and stability of the Web3 ecosystem.
  - header: What do stakers get in return?
    content: >
      In exchange for staking token into [Safety Module](insurance.landx.fi
      "Safety Module") stakers receive risk premium payments paid by
      [LandX](landx.fi "LandX") users, and rewards from [LandX](landx.fi
      "LandX") and [LandX](landx.fi "LandX") partners. You can claim the risk
      premium payments rewards at any time.

      Most pools give risk premiums in USDC, and rewards in LNDX/xToken.

  - header: What is a Cooldown Period?
    content: >
      Stakers can withdraw their funds after a cooldown period specified on the
      Pool Details page. For example, if the pool has a Cooldown Period of 1
      day, and you submit a withdrawal request now, you can execute the
      withdrawal transaction 24 hours (1 day) later.
  - header: What is a Pool Cap (pool is Sold Out)?
    content: >
      The Pool Cap is a limit on the maximum amount of tokens that can be
      deposited into a pool. If the Pool Cap is reached, it means that the pool
      is "Sold Out" and is no longer accepting liquidity.
  - header: What can I do if the pool is Sold Out?
    content: >
      When the pool is Sold Out, (meaning that the pool has reached its maximum
      capacity and the amount of deposits is equal to the Pool Cap), you can
      either:

      A) Choose another pool

      OR

      B) Wait until either someone else leaves the pool

      OR

      C) Watch for announcements about raising the Pool Cap.
  - header: How does the LandX Safety Module protect xToken holders?
    content: >
      xToken holders are protected because the assets backing the xToken
      (farmland and future crops) are protected against loss where there debt of
      xTokens can't be repaid, and the collateral underlying an individual
      xToken debt position is no longer as valuable.


      The market price of xTokens is insulated from the potential loss of the
      underlying collateral. Each xToken is backed by farmland and future
      harvests. While the value of farmland does not change rapidly, there is a
      small probability that the crop in a given year will be lost, up to 100%
      of the crop. When that happens, there is a small probability that the
      agricultural crop producer (farmer) will not have any cash on hand to
      repay  the debt denominated in xToken, which introduces the risk of
      shortfall events for the [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol").


      The [Safety Module](insurance.landx.fi "Safety Module") allows the [LandX
      Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol") to fully transfer such risk to 3rd
      party stakers who stake their assets in exchange for risk premiums paid by
      [LandX](landx.fi "LandX") users and rewards from [LandX](landx.fi "LandX")
      and [LandX](landx.fi "LandX") partners.


      As a result, should the loss of crop caused by weather events and climate
      change (such as temperature being too hot, too cold, too much or too
      little rain), [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol") will receive a
      payout equal to the $ value of the lost crop. This feature provides a
      unique layer of protection, ensuring that the xToken is always be
      over-collateralized, protecting xToken holders from such unlikely but
      still probable events.
  - header: How does the LandX Safety Module protect LNDX token holders?
    content: >
      LNDX token holders are protected because the market the price of the LNDX
      token depends on current and future [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX
      Protocol") fees. In turn, [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol") fees
      are generated when xTokens are attractive to mint and hold. Because the
      [LandX Safety Module](insurance.landx.fi "LandX Safety Module") protects
      xToken holders, [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol") Revenue is no
      longer at risk of losing Protocol Revenue due to natural weather risks and
      climate change. Because [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol")
      Revenue is now protected, the LNDX token becomes much safer to hold and
      stake for anyone who wants to participate in an infrastructure layer that
      powers the next generation of Real World Asset (RWA) assets and the
      financing of the global food supply chain.

      How does the LandX Safety Module protect farmers who receive financing
      through the Landx Protocol?
    content: >
      Farmers who mint xTokens are protected because their repayment obligations
      are no longer at risk due to crop losses caused by extreme weather and
      climate change. If their farm experiences a crop loss due to weather
      events and climate change (such as temperature being too hot, too cold,
      too much or too little rain), their debt (denominated in xTokens) will be
      repaid by withdrawing of assets from the pools of capital backing the
      [Safety Module](insurance.landx.fi "Safety Module") in an amount equal to
      the $ value of the crop loss.
  - header: What is a Shortfall Event?
    content: >
      A Shortfall Event may occur when the farmer who minted the xToken
      experiences a loss of crop revenue, which which is their primary source of
      cash used to repay their obligations. While the xToken is backed by both
      farmland real estate and a share of the future crop, the loss of the crop
      could be devastating to the farmer, potentially rendering them unable to
      repay.


      *A second type of Shortfall Event is hacks and bugs, or bug bounty
      payouts, where the payouts are so large and severe that the value of the
      LandX Insurance Fund is insufficient to cover them. For example, if a
      whitehat discovers a critical bug, and is eligible for a bug bounty of
      $100k, but the LandX Insurance Fund is only $80k. A $100k payout is so
      large that the LandX Insurance Fund is completely depleted, and there are
      not enough funds to pay the whitehat the full bounty amount.*

      two-sided insurance markets.


      Using [Atomica.org](Atomica.org "Atomica.org"), DeFi protocols can deploy,
      bootstrap and manage their own Safety Module. For example, protocols like
      [LandX](Landx.fi "LandX") can deploy and embed protection and insurance of
      any kind, including smart contract hacks/bugs, stablecoins and LSDs
      de-pegging, economic attacks, oracle failure, etc., and even boost the
      amount of Bug Bounties they offer using 3rd party capital from depositors
      in their Safety Module.


      [Atomica's](Atomica.org "Atomica.org") mission is to reduce risk for DeFi
      users by offering a range of protection options and to provide capital
      efficiency for liquidity providers (stakers).
