  - header: What is LandX Safety Module?
    content: "The [LandX Safety Module](https://insurance.landx.fi/ \"LandX Safety Module\") is a widely used safety mechanism to protect real-world farmers and users of leading DeFi Protocols by providing asset-backed guarantees of safety and stability.\\\n\\\nSimilar to the [AAVE Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module \"AAVE Safety Module\"), the [LandX ISM](insurance.landx.fi \"LandX Safety Module\") is a security layer made of smart contracts and staked assets that protects the [LandX Protocol](landx.fi \"LandX Protocol\") and its users. It provides a selection of staking pools that produce yield funded by risk premiums (paid collectively by [LandX](https://land-x-safety-module.vercel.app/landx.fi) users) and rewards (subsidized by [LandX](https://land-x-safety-module.vercel.app/landx.fi)) in exchange for providing a stake and sharing the risk of insurance claims. Just like on any staking platform, there is a small probability that slashing may occur\_ should [LandX Protocol](https://insurance.landx.fi/) suffer from a Shortfall Event.\n\nThe Staking Pool APY depends on supply & demand, and is set programmatically, like interest rates in lending markets such as [AAVE](https://aave.com/ \"AAVE\") and [Compound](https://compound.finance/ \"Compound\").\n\n![](https://reports.atomica.org/landX/ISM_Fees_Flow_2024_02_07.svg)\n"
  - header: Why stake into LandX's Safety Module?
    content: >
      **Earn Real Yield**: Stakers receive risk premiums and rewards. Rewards
      are accrued in real time in exchange for adding liquidity to the [Safety
      Module](insurance.landx.fi "Safety Module").


      **Diversify Your Portfolio**: The [Safety Module](insurance.landx.fi
      "Safety Module") offers a unique chance to diversify your portfolio with
      an uncorrelated asset while actively contributing to the safety and
      stability of the Web3 ecosystem.

  - header: What do stakers get in return?
    content: >
      In exchange for staking token into the [Safety Module](insurance.landx.fi
      "Safety Module"), participants receive risk premium payments paid by
      [LandX](landx.fi "LandX") users, and rewards from [LandX](landx.fi
      "LandX") and its partners. You can claim the risk premium payments rewards
      at any time.

      Most pools disburse risk premiums in $USDC, and rewards in either $LNDX
      and/or xTokens.

  - header: What is a stacking pool withdrawal delay?
    content: >
      Stakers can withdraw their funds after the pool withdrawal delay specified
      on the Pool Details page. For example, if the pool has a withdrawal delay
      of **14** day, and you submit a withdrawal request now, you can execute
      the withdrawal transaction **14** days later.


      If you initiated the withdrawal request, you will not be eligible to
      receive any rewards from the date you submitted the withdrawal request.


      \

      **Example:**


      * If you created the withdrawal request on March 1st, you can withdraw
      funds after **14** days, on March 15th.

      * The withdrawal windows will be open for 3 days from the March 15th to
      March 18th.

      * If you have not withdrawn funds, the withdrawal request will expire
      after the March 18th.

      * If the withdrawal request has expired, you should create another
      withdrawal request, you will be able to withdraw funds after **14** days
      after the withdrawal request submission.
  - header: What is a Pool Cap (pool is Sold Out)?
    content: >
      The Pool Cap is a limit on the maximum amount of tokens that can be
      deposited into a pool. If the Pool Cap is reached, it means that the pool
      is "Sold Out" and is no longer accepting liquidity.
  - header: What can I do if the pool is Sold Out?
    content: >
      When the pool is **sold out**, (meaning that the pool has reached its
      maximum capacity and the amount of deposits is equal to the **pool cap**),
      you can:


      * Choose another pool

      * Watch for announcements about raising the pool cap

      * Wait until someone leaves the pool and space becomes available
  - header: How does the LandX Safety Module protect xToken holders?
    content: "xToken holders are protected against the possibility of circumstances that prevent farmers from being able to repay their xToken debt. The assets backing xTokens are insured against loss that result in a debt of xTokens that can't be repaid, and the collateral underlying an individual xToken debt position is no longer as valuable.\n\nThe ISM insulates the market price of xTokens against potential loss of underlying collateral.\_\n\nEach xToken is backed by farmland and future harvests. Farmland has famously low volatility, as do future harvest of agricultural commodities, but in order to eliminate all risk for LandX participants, the ISM protects against the small possibility of crop loss and shortfall events.\n\nThe [Safety Module](https://land-x-safety-module.vercel.app/insurance.landx.fi) allows LandX to fully transfer this risk to 3rd party stakers who stake their assets in exchange for risk premiums paid by [LandX](https://land-x-safety-module.vercel.app/landx.fi) users and rewards from [LandX](https://land-x-safety-module.vercel.app/landx.fi) and partners.\n\nAs a result, should the loss of crop caused by weather events and climate change (excessively high or low temperatures, droughts, and flooding), the [LandX Protocol](https://land-x-safety-module.vercel.app/landx.fi) will receive a payout equal to the USD value of the lost crop. This feature provides a unique layer of protection, ensuring that xTokens are always over-collateralized, shielding xToken holders from such unlikely but still possible events.\n"
  - header: How does the LandX Safety Module protect LNDX token holders?
    content: >
      LNDX token holders are protected because the market the price of the LNDX
      token depends on current and future [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX
      Protocol") fees. These fees are organically generated when users mint and
      hold xTokens. With the increased protection enjoyed by xToken holders,
      LandX is no longer at risk of losing revenue due to natural weather risks
      and climate change. Because [LandX
      Protocol](https://land-x-safety-module.vercel.app/landx.fi) Revenue is now
      protected, $LNDX has become much safer to hold and stake for anyone who
      wants to participate in an infrastructure layer that powers the next
      generation of Real World Asset (RWA) assets and the financing of the
      global food supply chain.
  - header: >-
      How does the LandX Safety Module protect farmers who receive financing
      through the Landx Protocol?
    content: >
      Farmers who mint xTokens are protected because their repayment obligations
      are no longer at risk due to crop losses caused by extreme weather and
      climate change. If their farm experiences a crop loss due to weather
      events and climate change (excessively high or low temperatures, droughts,
      and flooding), their debt (denominated in xTokens) will be repaid by
      withdrawing of assets from the pools of capital backing the [LandX Safety
      Module](insurance.landx.fi "Safety Module") in an amount equal to the USD
      value of the crop loss.
  - header: What is a Shortfall Event?
    content: >
      A Shortfall Event may occur when the farmer who minted the xToken
      experiences a loss of crop revenue, making it impossible to repay their
      obligations. While the xToken is backed by both farmland real estate and a
      share of the future crop, the loss of the crop could be devastating to the
      farmer, potentially rendering them unable to repay.


      A second type of Shortfall Event is hacks and bugs, or bug bounty payouts,
      where the payouts are so large and severe that the value of the LandX
      Insurance Fund is insufficient to cover them. For example, a whitehat
      discovering a critical bug with a payout of $100k while the LandX
      Insurance Fund only holds $80k, would completely deplete and then some.

      bootstrap and manage their own Safety Module. For example, protocols like
      [LandX](Landx.fi "LandX") can deploy and embed protection and insurance of
      any kind, including smart contract hacks/bugs, stablecoins and LSDs
      de-pegging, economic attacks, oracle failure, etc., and even boost the
      amount of Bug Bounties they offer using 3rd party capital from depositors
      in their Safety Module.


      [Atomica's](Atomica.org "Atomica.org") mission is to reduce risk for DeFi
      users by offering a range of protection options and to provide capital
      efficiency for liquidity providers (stakers).
