  - header: What is LandX Safety Module?
    content: >
      LandX Safety Module is a widely used safety mechanism to protect users of
      leading DeFi Protocols.\

      Similar to Aave Safety module, LandX Safety Module is a smart
      contract-based security layer made of smart contracts and staked assets
      which provides protection to the LandX Protocol and its users.


      For the users of LandX protocol, LandX Safety Module provides asset-backed
      guarantees of safety and soundness.


      For the stakers, Safety Module provides a selection of staking pools which
      provide yield funded by risk premiums paid by LandX users and rewards from
      LandX in exchange for providing a stake and sharing the risks with other
      stakers. Just like on most staking platforms, there is a small probability
      that stake may get slashed should LandX protocol suffer from a shortfall
      event.


      Staking Pool APY depends on supply & demand, and set programmatically,
      just like interest rates in lending markets like Aave and Compound are set
      programmatically based on utilization of capital pools.
  - header: Why stake into LandX's Safety Module?
    content: >
      Earn Real Yield: Stakers receive risk premiums and rewards. Rewards are
      accrued in real-time in exchange for adding liquidity into the Safety
      Module.  


      Diversify Your Portfolio: Safety Module offers a unique chance to
      diversify your portfolio with an uncorrelated asset (Safety Module Pool
      Token), while actively contributing to the safety and stability of the
      Web3 ecosystem.
  - header: What do stakers get in return?
    content: >
      In exchange for staking token into Safety Module stakers receive risk
      premium payments paid by LandX users, and rewards from LandX and LandX
      partners. You can claim the risk premium payments rewards at any time.

      Most pools give risk premiums in USDC, and rewards in LNDX/xToken. 
  - header: What is a Cooldown Period?
    content: >
      Stakers can withdraw their funds after a cooldown period specified in the
      Pool Details page. For example, if the pool has a Cooldown Period of 1
      day, and you send a request for withdrawal now, you can execute the
      withdrawal transaction 24 hours (1 day) later.
  - header: What is a Pool Cap (pool is Sold Out)?
    content: >
      The Pool Cap is a limit of the maximum amount of tokens that can be
      deposited into a pool. If the Pool Cap is reached, this means the pool is
      "Sold Out" and no longer accepting liquidity.
  - header: What can I do if the pool is Sold Out?
    content: >
      When the pool is Sold Out, (meaning that the pool has reached its maximum
      capacity and amount of deposits equal its Pool Cap), you can either:

      A) Choose another pool 

      OR 

      B) Wait until either somebody else exits the pool

      OR

      C) Watch for announcements of Pool Cap being increased.
  - header: How does the LandX Safety Module protect xToken holders?
    content: >
      xToken holders are protected because the assets backing the xToken
      (farmland and future crops) are protected against loss where there debt of
      xTokens can't be repaid, and the collateral underlying an individual
      xToken debt position is no longer as valuable. 


      The market price of xTokens is insulated from the potential loss of the
      underlying collateral. Each xToken is backed by farmland and future
      harvests. While the value of farmland does not change rapidly, there is a
      small probability that the crop in a given year will be lost, up to 100%
      of the crop. When that happens, there is a small probability that the
      agricultural crop producer (farmer) will not have any cash on hand to
      repay  the debt denominated in xToken, which introduces the risk of
      shortfall events for the [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol"). 


      The [Safety Module](insurance.landx.fi "Safety Module") allows the [LandX
      Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol") to fully transfer such risk to 3rd
      party stakers who stake their assets in exchange for risk premiums paid by
      [LandX](landx.fi "LandX") users and rewards from [LandX](landx.fi "LandX")
      and [LandX](landx.fi "LandX") partners.


      As a result, should the loss of crop caused by weather events and climate
      change (such as temperature being too hot, too cold, too much or too
      little rain), [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol") will receive a
      payout equal to the $ value of the lost crop. This feature provides a
      unique layer of protection, ensuring that the xToken is always be
      over-collateralized, protecting xToken holders from such unlikely but
      still probable events. 
  - header: How does the LandX Safety Module protect LNDX token holders?
    content: >
      LNDX token holders are protected because the market the price of the LNDX
      token depends on current and future [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX
      Protocol") fees. In turn, [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol") fees
      are generated when xTokens are attractive to mint and hold. Because the
      [LandX Safety Module](insurance.landx.fi "LandX Safety Module") protects
      xToken holders, [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol") Revenue is no
      longer at risk of losing Protocol Revenue due to natural weather risks and
      climate change. Because [LandX Protocol](landx.fi "LandX Protocol")
      Revenue is now protected, the LNDX token becomes much safer to hold and
      stake for anyone who wants to participate in an infrastructure layer that
      powers the next generation of Real World Asset (RWA) assets and the
      financing of the global food supply chain.
