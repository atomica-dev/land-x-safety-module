  - header: What is a Pool Cap (pool is Sold Out)?
    content: >

      "Sold Out" and no longer accepting liquidity.
  - header: What is LandX Safety Module?
    content: >
      LandX Safety Module is a widely used safety mechanism to protect users of
      leading DeFi Protocols.\

      Similar to Aave Safety module, LandX Safety Module is a smart
      contract-based security layer made of smart contracts and staked assets
      which provides protection to the LandX Protocol and its users.


      For the users of LandX protocol, LandX Safety Module provides asset-backed
      guarantees of safety and soundness.


      For the stakers, Safety Module provides a selection of staking pools which
      provide yield funded by risk premiums paid by LandX users and rewards from
      LandX in exchange for providing a stake and sharing the risks with other
      stakers. Just like on most staking platforms, there is a small probability
      that stake may get slashed should LandX protocol suffer from a shortfall
      event.


      Staking Pool APY depends on supply & demand, and set programmatically,
      just like interest rates in lending markets like Aave and Compound are set
      programmatically based on utilization of capital pools.
