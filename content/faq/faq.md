          - header: What is LandX Safety Module?
            content: >
              LandX Safety Module is a widely used safety mechanism to protect
              users of leading DeFi Protocols.  

              Similar to Aave Safety module, LandX Safety Module is a smart
              contract-based security layer made of smart contracts and staked
              assets which provides protection to the LandX Protocol and its
              users.


              For the users of LandX protocol, LandX Safety Module provides
              asset-backed guarantees of safety and soundness. 


              For the stakers, Safety Module provides a selection of staking
              pools which provide yield funded by risk premiums paid by LandX
              users and rewards from LandX in exchange for providing a stake and
              sharing the risks with other stakers. Just like on most staking
              platforms, there is a small probability that stake may get slashed
              should LandX protocol suffer from a shortfall event. 


              Staking Pool APY depends on supply & demand, and set
              programmatically, just like interest rates in lending markets like
              Aave and Compound are set programmatically based on utilization of
              capital pools. 
          - header: How does the LandX Safety Module protect xToken holders?
            content: >
              xToken holders are protected because the assets backing xToken
              (farmland and future crop) are protected against loss where there
              debt of xTokens can't be repaid, and collateral underlying an
              individual xToken debt position is no longer as valuable.


              Market price of xTokens is insulated from the potential loss of
              underlying collateral. Every xToken is backed by farmland and
              future crop. While value of farmland does not change rapidly,
              there is a small probability that crop in a given year will be
              lost, up to 100% oif the crop. When that happens, there is a small
              probability that the agricultural crop producer (farmer) will not
              have any cash on hand to repay debt denominated in xToken, which
              introduces the risk of shortfall events for the LandX Protocol.


              Safety Module enables LandX Protocol to fully transfer such risk
              to 3rd party stakers who stake their assets in exchange for a
              share in LandX Protocol Fees.


              As a result, should the loss of crop caused by weather events and
              climate change (such as temperature being too hot, too cold, too
              much or too little rain), LandX Protocol will receive a payout
              equal to the $ value of crop lost. This feature provides a unique
              layer of protection, ensuring that xToken will always be
              overcollateralized, protecting xToken holders from such unlikely
              but still probable events.
          - header: How does the LandX Safety Module protect LNDX token holders?
            content: >
              LNDX token holders are protected because market price of LNDX
              token depends on current and future LandX Protocol fees. In turn,
              LandX Protocol fees are generated when xToken is attractive to
              mint and hold. Because LandX Safety Module protects xToken
              holders, LandX Protocol Revenue is no longer at risk of losing
              Protocol Revenue due to natural weather risk and climate change.
              Because LNDX Protocol Revenue is now protected, LNDX token becomes
              much safer to hold and stake for anyone who wants to participate
              in an infrastructure layer that powers the next generation of Real
              World Asset (RWA) assets and financing of the global food supply
              chain.

              How does the LandX Safety Module protect farmers who obtain
              financing using LandX Protocol?
            content: >
              Farmers who are minting xTokens are protected because their
              repayment obligations are no longer at risk due to loss of crop
              caused by extreme weather and climate change. If their farm
              experiences loss of crop caused by weather events and climate
              change (such as temperature being too hot, too cold, too much or
              too little rain), their debt (denominated in xToken) will be
              repaid through withdrawal of assets from Capital Pools backing the
              Safety Module in the amount equal to the $ value of crop lost up.
