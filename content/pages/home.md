      For stakers, LandX Safety Module provides a selection of staking pools.
      Stakers are earning staking rewards which is Real Yield - a share of LandX
      Protocol fees. Just like on most staking platforms, there is a small
      probability that stake may get slashed should LandX protocol suffer from a
      shortfall event greater than LandX DAO Insurance Fund. [Learn more](/faq
